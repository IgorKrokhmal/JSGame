Idea of game is endless enemy killer
In this game you need to kill as much enemies as you can and try to beat your's score record
On hex based map you can atack one target and multiply targets, and you can move
I am used OOP, for better structure
But game has some troubles: enemies doesn't has goal for respawn, and them can't attack hero, so they defenceless
